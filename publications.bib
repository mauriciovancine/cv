	abstract = {Amphibians are among the most threatened vertebrates in the world and this is also true for those inhabiting the Atlantic Forest hotspot, living in ecosystems that are highly degraded and threatened by anthropogenic activities. We present a data set containing information about amphibian communities sampled throughout the Atlantic Forest Biome in South America. The data were extracted from 389 bibliographic references (articles, books, theses, and dissertations) representing inventories of amphibian communities from 1940 to 2017. The data set includes 17,619 records of 528 species with taxonomic certainty, from 1,163 study sites. Of all the records, 14,450 (82\%) were classified using the criterion of endemism; of those, 7,787 (44\%) were considered endemic and 6,663 (38\%) were not. Historically, multiple sampling methods were used to survey amphibians, the most representative methods being active surveys (82.1\%), surveys at breeding sites (20\%), pitfall traps (15.3\%), and occasional encounters (14.5\%). Species richness averaged 15.2 Æ 11.3 (mean Æ {SD}), ranging from 1 to 80 species per site. We found a low dominance in the communities, with 10 species occurring in about 26\% of communities: Physalaemus cuvieri (4.1\%), Dendropsophus minutus (3.8\%), Boana faber (3.1\%), Scinax fuscovarius (2.8\%), Leptodactylus latrans (2.7\%), Leptodactylus fuscus (2.6\%), Boana albopunctata (2.3\%), Dendropsophus nanus (1.6\%), Rhinella ornata (1.6\%), and Leptodactylus mystacinus (1.6\%). This data set represents a major effort to compile inventories of amphibian communities for the Neotropical region, filling a large gap in the data on the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We hope this data set can be used as a credible tool in the proposal of new studies on amphibian sampling and even in the development of conservation planning for these taxa. This information also has great relevance for macroecological studies, being foundational for both conservation and restoration strategies in this biodiversity hotspot.

	abstract = {Remnant habitat patches immersed within biofuel cropland matrices can retain considerable species diversity, although the effects of land use change on species persistence in historically modiﬁed landscapes remain unclear. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most fragmented South American biodiversity hotspots and retains about 12\% of its original vegetation cover. Most of these remnants are distributed in small isolated fragments immersed mainly within pastures and sugarcane monocultures. Here we examine how species richness and composition of medium and large-sized mammals are explained by forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount at the landscape scale. We sampled 22 fragmented landscapes dominated by sugarcane plantations along a wide gradient of forest cover (3\% to 96\%) in southeastern Brazil. We recorded 88\% of terrestrial mammal species expected for this region, but many likely local extirpations were detected at the landscape scale, with losses between 50\% to 80\% of species. Most of the landscapes were highly depleted of forest-specialist species, with replacements by exotics and/or species typical of non-forest habitats. We found that total mammalian species richness, which includes forest-specialists, generalists, exotics and non-forest dwelling species, was not affected by landscape metrics, such as forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount. Nevertheless, forest cover was important predictor of the presence of three ungulates, a medium-sized rodent, and an armadillo. Local mammalian communities exhibited a high degree of species turnover between landscapes, representing 95\% of the total β-diversity. In this region, where there was no regional extinction, landholder compliance with the Brazilian Forest Bill and restoration measures will enhance habitat connectivity and mammal persistence across the wider unprotected countryside.},

Human and climate change impacts are the principal drivers of species loss in both biomes, more severely in the Atlantic Forest. In response to species loss, the main conservation action is the creation of protected areas ({PAs}). Current knowledge and research on the {PA} network's conservation eﬃciency is scarce, and existing studies have mainly considered a past temporal view. In this study, we tested the eﬃciency of the current {PA} network to maintain climatically stable areas ({CSAs}) across the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. To this, we used an ecological niche modeling approach to biome and paleoclimatic simulations. We propose three categories of conservation priority areas for both biomes, considering {CSAs}, {PAs} and intact forest remnants. The biomes vary in their respective {PA} networks' protection eﬃciency. Regarding protect {CSAs}, the Amazon {PA} network is four times more eﬃcient than the Atlantic Forest {PA} network. New conservation eﬀorts in these two forest biomes require diﬀerent approaches. We discussed the conservation actions that should be taken in each biome to increase the eﬃciency of the {PA} network, considering both the creation and expansion of {PAs} as well as restoration programs.},

Results: We show that forest fragmentation affects seed dispersal interactions negatively, and the decreased area of functionally connected forest, rather than increased edge effects, is the main driver behind the loss of interactions. Both the seed disperser availability for the local tree communities and in particular the proportion of interactions provided by keystone seed dispersers decline with increasing degree of fragmentation. Importantly, just 21 keystone species provided {\textgreater}40\% of all interactions. The numbers of interactions provided by keystone and non-keystone species, however, were equally negatively affected by fragmentation, suggesting that seed dispersal interactions may not be rewired under strong fragmentation effects.
Conclusions: We highlight the importance of understanding the fragmentation-induced compositional shifts in seed disperser communities as they may lead to lagged},

              Invasive species can significantly affect native species when their niches are similar. Ecological and morphological similarities between the invasive Australian palm,
              Archontophoenix cunninghamiana,
              and the native palm from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,
              Euterpe edulis
              , suggest that they have similar environmental requirements and functional roles (i.e., the function a species performs in an ecosystem). This similarity raises concerns about how the invasive palm could impact the native species in the present and future. We used spatial (species occurrences) and ecological information (frugivory events) to characterize the environmental niche and functional role of the two palms and assess their overlap. In addition, we predicted the potential area of occurrence of each palm within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest under current and future climate conditions.We estimated the environmental conditions used by the invasive plant based on its native distribution only, and based on all areas where the species is able to establish across the globe. We found that the environmental niches of the two palm species overlap up to 39\%, which corresponds to 50\% of the current geographic distribution of E. edulis in the Atlantic Forest. In the areas where the two species potentially co-occur, the impact of the invasive species on the native should be influenced by the invasive species interactions with frugivores. We found that the frugivory functional role of the two palms was similar (84\% overlap) which suggest that
              A. cunninghamiana
              might disrupt the seed dispersal of the native palm. However, co-occurrence between the palms may decline with future climate change, as the potentially environmental suitable area for the invasive palm is predicted to decline by 10\% to 55\%. Evaluating the similarity in both the environmental niche, of the native and global extent, and the functional role of native and invasive plants provides a detailed understanding of the potential impact of invasive species on native species now and in the future.},

	abstract = {Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most damaging invasive species in the world and can have a profound impact on the distribution of native species. Nevertheless, there still are limitations on the species’ current fine-scale spatial information, which is needed to develop effective management measures. Here, we used Species Distribution Models ({SDMs}) and niche overlap analysis to estimate potential conflict areas between the wild boar and the native southern pudu (Pudu puda), which is a bioindicator of the forest conservation status within the Nahuel Huapi National Park ({NHNP}), Argentina. The two species’ environmental niche overlaps by 40\%, which results in a wide geographical overlap between wild boar and pudu distributions. The distribution model predicted that the wild boar potential distribution occupies 22\% of the national park and overlaps up to 67\% with the pudu distribution, which in turn occupies 20\% of the park. Based on our models, we classified 12\% of the park as extreme management priority areas, because both species are present. High priority areas, where wild boars have the potential to invade but will not overlap with pudu populations, represent 10\% of the park. Medium priority areas, where wild boars do not threaten pudu populations, and low priority areas, with no potential presence of either species, are 8\% and 68\%, respectively. The results of this study show how {SDMs} developed at local scales can support the management and monitoring of native and invasive species and help guide the allocation of efforts and resources for management actions focused on protected areas.},

	abstract = {Mammals are important components of biodiversity that have been drastically and rapidly impacted by climate change, habitat loss, and anthropogenic pressure. Understanding key species distribution to optimize conservation targets is both urgent and necessary to reverse the current biodiversity crisis. Herein, we applied habitat suitability models for a key Neotropical forest ungulate, the white-lipped peccary ({WLP} Tayassu pecari), to investigate the effects of climate and landscape modifications on its distribution, which has been drastically reduced in Brazil. We used 318 primary records of {WLP} to derive habitat suitability maps across Brazil. Our models included bioclimatic, topographic, landscape, and human influence predictors in two modelling approaches. Models including all categories of predictors obtained the highest predictive ability and showed prevalence of suitable areas in forested regions of the country, covering 49\% of the Brazilian territory. Filtering out small forest fragments ({\textless}2050 ha) reduced the suitable area by 5\%, with a further reduction of 4\% that was caused by deforestation until 2020, therefore until 2020, the species has suffered a reduction of {\textasciitilde}60\% from its historical range in Brazil. Of the 40\% of the Brazilian territory suitable to {WLP}, only 12\% is protected. In the Atlantic Forest, only half of all protected areas have suitable habitat for {WLP} and even less in Pantanal (44\%), Cerrado (14\%) and Caatinga (7\%). In a second modelling approach, mapping the areas with suitable climate and those with suitable landscapes separately, allowed us to identify four categories of conservation values, and showed that only 17\% of the Brazilian territory has both high landscape and climatic suitability for {WLP}. Our models can help inform complementary conservation management strategies and actions that could be essential in slowing down and possibly reversing current trends of population and geographic range reductions for the species, thereby averting a possible future collapse of forest ecosystem functioning in the Neotropical region.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we evaluated the dynamics of native vegetation cover ({NVC}) fragmentation from 1985 to 2018 in the most threatened basin of the Rio Tapajos ({TRB}), a tributary of the Amazon River. The study sought to understand how land use pressures negatively impacted the remnants of the agricultural matrix and the biodiversity of local biotas. To this end, we created a sampling grid with hexagons of 50,000 hectares each, compartmentalized as follows: for the entire basin area, we used a grid of 1255 hexagons in the analyses; in the northern portion of the basin (Amazon biome), we used a grid with 965 hexagons and in the southern portion of the basin (Cerrado biome) we used a grid with 290 hexagons. In these grids, we apply six landscape ecology metrics: number, size, edge, isolation, remnants and interiority, unprecedented in landscape studies. The hexagons created were our analytical units in the study of isolation and habitat loss between forest remnants (Fo) and savannas (Sa) in the three defined Core Areas. The results showed that the fragmentation dynamics in {TRB} was not a single and isolated event in the three compartments analyzed, with different clusters in the studied portions. The number of remnants grew exponentially in the landscape, in the first 20 years of the study (1985- 2005), and their areas lost half their original sizes in both parts of the basin. Regardless of remnant size or typology, the edge effect was high in both small and large patches (Fo = 15\% and Sa = 20\%). The isolation of the remnants was greater and increasing in the northern portion of the basin, in 20 years (1985-2005), the isolation class 100 to 1000 meters increased 31\% for the Fo patches, while the Sa patches increased only 11\% in the southern part of the basin. The total losses of remnants (Fo+Sa) in the northern portion were 38\% and 41\% for the remainders of the southern portion of the basin. It is important to emphasize that this study is the largest assessment ever carried out in the entire area of an Amazon watershed, with the objective of creating a database for comparative studies with other threatened watersheds. Our analyzes showed that 60\% of the {TRB} Plateau area was converted to planted pastures and annual crops. If the same rates of deforestation and fragmentation remain at the current level, the prognosis for 2040 will not be encouraging.},

	abstract = {Abstract Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosystem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of São Paulo represents only 3\% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33\% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, São Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in São Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of São Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several “savanna-dwelling” species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Brocket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirão Preto and Jundiaí. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies ({eDNA}, {iDNA}, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity.},

            Climate change and habitat loss have been identified as the main causes of species extinction. Forest regeneration and protected areas are essential to buffer climate change impacts and to ensure quality habitats for threatened species. We assessed the current and future environmental suitability for the maned sloth, Bradypus torquatus, under both future climate and forest restoration scenarios, using ecological niche modeling. We compared environmental suitability for two Evolutionarily Significant Units ({ESUnorth} and {ESUsouth}) using two climate change scenarios for 2070, and three potential forest regeneration scenarios. Likewise, we evaluated the protection degree of the suitable areas resulting from the models, according to Brazilian law: {PA}—Protected Areas; {PPA}—Permanent Protection Areas (environmentally sensitive areas in private properties); and {LR}—Legal Reserves (natural vegetation areas in private properties). Finally, we calculated the deficit of {PPA} and {LR} in each {ESU}, considering the current forest cover. Forest regeneration might mitigate the deleterious effects of climate change by maintaining and increasing environmental suitability in future scenarios. The {ESUnorth} contains more suitable areas (21,570 km²) than the {ESUsouth} (12,386 km²), with an increase in all future scenarios (up to 45,648 km² of new suitable areas), while {ESUsouth} might have a significant decrease (up to 7,546 km² less). Suitable areas are mostly unprotected ({ESUnorth}—65.5\% and {ESUsouth}—58.3\%). Therefore, {PPA} and {PA} can maintain only a small portion of current and future suitable areas. Both {ESUs} present a high deficit of {PPA} and {LR}, highlighting the necessity to act in the recovery of these areas to accomplish a large-scale restoration, mitigate climate change effects, and achieve, at least, a minimum forested area to safeguard the species. Notwithstanding, a long-term conservation of B. torquatus will benefit from forest regeneration besides those minimum requirements, allied to the protection of forest areas.},

	abstract = {Pará’s Northeast has undergone deep changes during its occupation cycles. In this region, the conversion of forest to other classes of land use and cover has been going on for hundreds of years. With the advent of Remote Sensing, it is possible to quantify these changes. In this sense, the objective of the study was to analyze the landscape dynamics of three watersheds in Pará’s Northeast between 1985 and 2019, and the implications of these changes in the classes of forest formation and mangrove. The methodology adopted included tools associated with geotechnologies to support an integrated analysis within the scope of watersheds. The results showed a conversion of forest to pasture proportional to the area of the municipality of Castanhal/{PA} (approximately 1,000 km²). The largest range of alteration was concentrated in the areas of headwaters of the hydrographic basins, such as the expressive increase of 159\% in the number of patches of the forest formation class (from 2547 to 6604); the reduction of the average area of forest formation patch from 121.9 to 31.9 ha; and the reduction in the core percentage of this class from 33.7 to 16.2\%. On the other hand, no significant changes were observed in the mangrove class in the study area. Thus, measures for the conservation and recovery of important areas for the maintenance of coastal ecosystems and local water systems must be prioritized by decision-makers.},
